# Biometric-Student-Attendance-System
This is a basic level attendance system that uses fingerprints. Meant to be a computer/desktop application, not smartphone application.
I used arduino, and netbeans. An external fingerprint sensor was involved, and an arduino board as well.
There's definitely better ways to do this, I was on a tight budget..haha.
To anyone who finds this useful, you're welcome.
